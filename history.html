                    <p class="green">The walk was a vague track, down the hill to Leith, keeping to the west of the
                        Greenside burn and skirting the sandy mounds through which innumerable bubbling springs
                        found
                        their way towards the sea. To his east lay the lands of Restalrig, whose laird, Sir Robert
                        Logan, had sold the right to use all paths and passages on his land to the town in 1398.
                        Away to the west stood the Peel tower on the ridge, the Pilrig, owned
                        until her death in 1463 by Mary of Gueldres, widow of James II.</p>
                    <p class="green">In a time, James II granted the town a recreation ground at Greenside in 1456.
                        This was used for jousting and, until the Reformation, for plays like the Satire of the Three
                        Estates. Tradition has it that Mary Queen of Scots first saw Bothwell there, as he rode his
                        charger down the precipitous hill side to the Tournament.</p>
                    <p class="green">It was a dangerous journey. An array of human corpses, swinging from the gallows
                        set on top of a low mound by the road was an experience calculated by the good burgesses of
                        Edinburgh to awe the most hardened man. </p>

                    <p class="green">In 1623, Pilrig was owned by Gilbert Kirkwood, and Edinburgh
                        goldsmith, who had bought it from the Moneypenny family. He and his wife, Margaret Foulis, built
                        a house in the Dutch style. They planted two rows of beech and elm trees ending at a simple
                        fence and some broken ground along what later became Leith Walk. There was no avenue between the
                        trees, and no entrance gate, but at either side was a little house. At Greenside the Town had
                        let out the Playfield as arable land and pasture.</p>
                    <p class="green">In 1650, General David Leslie formulated his plan for the defense of Edinburgh
                        against the army of Oliver Cromwell. Leslie decided to have two deep trenches dug all the way
                        from the end of the Calton Hill to Leith. The earth thrown up by the digging formed a rampart to
                        the west of the trenches, more or less on the line of Leith Walk.
                    </p>
                    <p class="green">In 1695, the Town Council recorded the payment of 60 scots pounds yearly to James
                        Lauder, gardener, Burgess of Edinburgh, “to be keeper and overseer of the walk betwix Edinburgh
                        and Leith, for laying of Channell (gravel) thereon”. George Gigo had been laying gravel on the
                        walk before. All wheeled traffic was banned from using the walk. According to Robert Chambers:
                        “it was about twenty
                        feet wide and it was not completely straight. It skirted the infamous Gallow-lee where witches
                        were strangled and burnt, and Covenanters hanged and beheaded, and wound past houses and a
                        fairly large pond.”

                    <p class="green">By the time, Leith walk was green and sorrounded by nursery gardens.
                        In 1764, Professor John Hope purchased thirteen acres of land, with the
                        trees and growing timer thereon, on the west side of Leith Walk at Shurbhill, for the new
                        Botanick Gardens. The first head gardener was John Williamson, for whom a neat two storeyed
                        house was built at the entrance gates. The house was still there until 2009, were they moved it
                        to the Botanical Garden in Inverleith. The botanical garden was moved in 1818. It was from
                        Shurbhill that the tea plant seedlings were sent to Blantyre to start the tea industry in
                        Africa.
                    </p>
                    <p class="green">There are references of other gardening firms – Methven’s, Dod’s, Reid’s,
                        specialized in
                        Camellias, and to James Grieve of Pilrig Street, after whom the well-known apple is named.

                    <p class="green">Nowadays, Leith Walk is no longer the green garden it used to be and mostly
                        buildings shape its

                    <p class="green">At the end of the Napoleonic War, then, Leith Walk was an established
                        carriageway, with good houses at the top; cheaper tenements in Greenside, where many of the
                        inhabitants had workshops and forges; a sprinkling of timber-yards, marble workshops, foundries
                        flint and crownglass-works and manufactories further down, and among the remaining old houses
                        still a number of thriving market-gardens.

                    <p class="green">Middlefield was occupied in 1793 by a paper-stainer named Macmillan who advertised
                        the upper flats to let as country lodgins. Thomas Carlyle, an Scottish historian and essayist,
                        took rooms there to escape the noise of mason-work in the New Town.
                        but he wrote to his mother that the barking dog kept him awake at
                        night. Thomas Carlyle’s rooms were in Moray Street, changed later to Spey Street because of
                        postal confusion. Only the lower front walls of the Spey Street tenements now remain.
                    </p>
                    <p class="green">Thomas experienced in Leith Walk a striking spiritual rebirth which he describes in
                        his work Sartor
                        Resartus (Latin: “The Tailor Re-tailored”). It is humorous essay about the philosophy, the
                        symbolism, and the influence of clothes. He declares that, while most of Sartor Resartus is
                        mere symbolical myth, the sudden spiritual awakening of the imaginary
                        Teufelsdrockh, a character of his essay, happened literally to himself one day in Leith Walk in
                        1821

                    <p class="green">Another anecdote of his and according David Masson, "For some purpose or other, he
                        was going down Leith Walk,
                        the long street of houses, stone-yards, and gaps of vacant space, which leads from Edin- burgh
                        to its sea-port of Leith. In front of him, and also walking towards Leith, was a solid,
                        quiet-looking countryman. They had not gone far from Edinburgh when there ad\anced to them from
                        the opposite direction a sailor, so drunk that he needed the whole breadth of the footpath to
                        himself. Taking some umbrage at the countryman, the sailor came to a stop, and addressed him
                        suddenly, “ Go to H “ looking him full in the face. “ ‘Od, man, I’m gaun to Leith,” said the
                        countryman, as if merely pleading a previous engagement, and walked on, Carlyle following him
                        and evading the sailor."
                    </p>
                    <p class="green">Definitely, any visitor or inhabitant of Leith Walk may not have a spiritual
                        awakening or a hallucination, but the encounter with different characters alienated by alcohol
                        or other substances is a very common event in our beloved walk even in our days, with the
                        particularity that most people would react like the countryman, as if such events were part of
                        the daily life of Leith Walk.

                        had no apprenticeship; he also had no money to purchase stock. However, William gave him all the
                        advice he could and encouraged him to use the family’s tattered collection of books left over
                        from happier and more prosperous times. Robert took a small shop on Leith Walk opposite Pilrig

                        by merchants, clerks, strangers and sea-faring people. In the early years of the present
                        century, it was the daily resort of a multitude of odd-looking dependents on public charity –
                        such as old bling fiddlers seated by the wayside; sailors deficient in an arm or a leg, with
                        long queues hanging down their backs- always singing ballads about sea-fights; and cripples of
                        various sort. Besides its hosts of mendicants, the Walk was garnished with small shops for the
                        sale of shells, corals and other foreign curiosities. It was also furnished with a number of

                        streets in Edinburgh or Leith, the Walk in former times was certainly the street for boys and
                        girls. From top to bottom, it was a scene of wonders and enjoyments peculiarly devoted to
                        children. Besides the panoramas and caravan-shows, which were comparatively transient
                        spectacles, there were several shows upon Leith Walk, which might be considered as regular
                        fixtures and part of the country-cousin sights of Edinburgh. Who can forget the waxworks of 'Mrs
                        Sands, widow of the late G. Sands,' which occupied a laigh shop opposite to the
                        present Haddington Place, and at the door of which, besides various parrots and sundry birds of
                        Paradise, sat the wax figure of a little man in the dress of a French courtier of the ancien
                        régime, reading one eternal copy of the Edinburgh Advertiser. The very outsides of these wonder-
                        shops was an immense treat; all along the Walk it was one delicious scene of squirrels hung out
                        at doors, and monkeys dressed like soldiers and sailors, with holes behind where their tails
                        came through. Even the half-penniless boy might here get his appetite for wonders to some extent
                        gratified."
                    </p>
                    <p class="green">Chambers continues: "Besides being of old the chosen place for shows, Leith Walk
                        was the Rialto for
                        objects. This word requires explanation. It is applied by the people of Scotland to persons who
                        have been born with or overtaken by some miserable personal evil. From one end to the other,
                        Leith Walk was garrisoned by poor creatures under these circumstances, who, from handbarrows,
                        wheelbarrows, or iron legs, if peradventure they possessed such adjuncts, entreated the
                        passengers for charity - some by voices of song, some by speech, some by driddling, as Burns
                        calls it, on fiddles or grinding on hand-organs - indeed, a complete continuous ambuscade
                        against the pocket. Shows and objects have now alike vanished from Leith Walk. It is now a plain
                        street, composed of little shops of the usual suburban appearance, and characterised by nothing
                        peculiar, except perhaps a certain air of pretension, which is in some
                        cases abundantly ludicrous."</p>

                        most remarkable of the recent events in the history of Edinburgh, and in
                        our national annals, is the visit of His Majesty George the Fourth to Scotland, and honouring
                        the Palace of his ancestors with his presence. On the 14th August 1822, the Royal George, having
                        His Majesty on board, anchored in Leith Roads. While here His Majesty received the melancholy
                        intelligence of the death of the Marquis of Londonderry."

                        Majesty did not land till the 15th about noon. He was dressed in an Admiral's uniform, with a
                        Thistle and sprig of Heath on his hat; and a superb St Andrew's Cross, presented to him by Sir
                        Walter Scott, in name of the Ladies of Edinburgh."
                    </p>
                    <p class="green">"This evening the town of Leith was most
                        superbly illuminated. The procession to Edinburgh by Leith Walk was magnificent; and at Gayfield
                        Place His Majesty was received by the Lord Provost and Magistrates, who, at a temporary
                        barrier, delivered to him the Keys of the City."

                        a great interest
                        in chemistry. He has built a small laboratory behind his house at the end of Smith’s Place – an

                        York
                        Place. Tom used to raise a flag on his father’s
                        house as a signal to James to run down Leith Walk to share in experiments conducted by his
                        father.

                    <p class="green">Alexander Nasmyth was a Scottish portrait and
                        landscape painter, a pupil of Allan Ramsay. He married the daughter of Sir James Foulis, 5th
                        Baronet of Colinton.
                        Nasmyth's six daughters all became notable artists. His daughters were Jane, Barbara, Margaret,
                        Elizabeth, Anne and Charlotte. His eldest son, Patrick Nasmyth, studied under his father, then
                        went to London and attracted attention as a landscapist.

                    <p class="green"> Another son, James Nasmyth, and the one who I am refering here, was a Scottish
                        engineer and
                        inventor famous for his development of the steam hammer. He was the co-founder of Nasmyth,
                        Gaskell and Company manufacturers of machine tools. He retired at the age of 48, and moved to
                        Penshurst, Kent where he developed his hobbies of astronomy and photography. When he was young,
                        he built a prizewinning stream carriage at Anderson’s Foundry, located as well in Leith Walk.

                    <p class="green">Nasmyth, is his autobriography, declares about Greenside:</p>
                    <p class="green"> “It happened that close to the Calton Hill, in the valley at the northern side,
                        there were many workshops where interesting trades were carried on; there were coppersmiths,
                        tinsmiths, brassfounders, goldbeaters, and blacksmiths. Their shops were all arranged in a busy
                        group at the foot of the hill... their workshops were open to the inspection of passers-by.
                        Little boys looked in and saw the men at work amidst the blaze of fires and the beating of
                        hammers... One of my greatest enjoyments when a child was in going out with the servants to
                        the Calton, and wait while the “claes” bleached in the sun on the grassy slopes of the hill. The
                        air was bright and fresh and pure. The lasses regarded these occasions as a sort of holiday. One
                        or two of the children usually accompanied them. They sat together, and the servants told us
                        their auld-warld stories; common enough in those days, but which have now, in a measure been
                        forgotten... They ran after butterflies and the bumbees, and made acquaintance in a small way
                        with the beauties of nature. Then the servants opened their baskets of provisions, and we had a
                        delightful picnic. Though I am noiting about seventy years w wrafter the date of these events, I
                        can almost believe that I am enjoying the delightful perfume of the wild thyme and the fragant
                        plants and flowers, wafted around me by the warm breezes of the Calton hillside”

                        flowers seem to be a thing of the past, giving way to concrete, brick and the cold, unloving
                        architecture that characterises our days.

                        the then newly built 2 Baxter’s Place at the head of Leith Walk. Stevenson lived on Baxter’s
                        Place at the head of Leith Walk for most of his later years, moving from no.2 to the far
                        larger
                        no.1 around 1820.

                        Stevenson House" in his honor. The name was
                        removed when the building was converted into a Marriott Hotel in 2017.

                        lighthouses,
                        round the coasts, and had built up a thriving engineering practice from his home at Baxter’s

                    <p class="green">Stevenson died at 1 Baxter’s Place on 12 July 1850 in Edinburgh. Stevenson made
                        drawings for the complete regrading of Leith Walk and this work was carried out by the city,
                        though under the Leith Walk Trust a toll was imposed at the old Gallowlee in 1809 to help to
                        pay for it.
                    </p>
                    <p class="green">Robert Chambers, in Gazeteers of Scotland - 1838, declares: "While
                        the above mentioned improvements were in the course of
                        execution, the extension of the city to the east of the New Town went on very slowly, and for
                        many years the road to Leith by Leith Walk remained in a wretched condition. Active measures
                        were, however, adopted to remodel " the Walk," which has been done at a prodigious expense,
                        liquidated by a toll-bar. This way, which is altogether paved, and is more than a mile in
                        length, is now one of the most noble thoroughfares in the world, being perhaps only surpassed by
                        the BROADWAY OF NEW YORK, to which it has not inaptly been compared."

                    <p class="green">Robert Louis Stevenson, a Scottish novelist, poet and travel writer, most noted
                        for writing Treasure Island, Kidnapped, Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, and A Child's
                        Garden of Verses, used to spend some of his days at his grandfather's house.
                    </p>
                    <p class="green">He as well left an invaluable written picture of what Leith Walk used to be: “My
                        grandfather’s house must have been a paradise for boys. It was a great size and had an infinity
                        of cellars below, and of garrets, apple-lofts etc., above, and it had a long garden which ran
                        down to the foot of the Calton Hill. Its front was Leith Walk, with its traffic; at one side was
                        a very deserted lane with the office door and carpenter’s shop and the like: and behind were the
                        big open slops of the Calton Hill”
                    </p>
                    <p class="green">He loved his Saturday trips to Leith with his grandfather to see the ships;
                        they always passed Mr Smith’s shop at the corner of Union Street and Leith Walk where a model
                        theatre was set up in the window in working order, with sets of a forest, a combat or robbers
                        carousing, and the books of plays – “Penny Plain or Twopence Coloured” tumbled one upon another
                        beside it.
                    </p>
                    <p class="green">From the pictures, we can see that where it used to be Mr Smith’s shop, now there
                        is a coffee-tea shop, and that the garden at his grandfather's house now it is a hotel. </p>

                    <p class="green">With the changes, Pilrig free church was opened in 1843 and “in the midst of a
                        growing population
                        rapidly increased” until 1863 a handsome new church was built on the corner of Leith Walk and
                        Pilrig Street, to which Church Halls were added in 1893. Also, at Pilrig a group of Model
                        Building or colony houses were erected in 1851,
                        as an
                        effort to alleviate the housing problems. They are called "Shaw Colonies".
                    <p class="green">Finally, with the increasing population, legions of the “whores of Leith Walk”,
                        whose activities eventually became intolerable, Edinburgh introduced a new
                        legislation to drove them down past the Boundary Bar into streets which later had to be re-named
                        in
                        order to lose their ill reputation.

                        intended for Railway employees and other working people. They were solid buildings with little

                    <p class="green">The horse-drawn buses were followed by horse-trams in the 1870’s, cable cars in
                        1899 and electric cable cars in 1910.

                    <p class="green"> Below Pilrig, the trams converted to electricity in 1904. They were operated by
                        Leith, and at
                        one time it was necessary to change vehicles there. It was well-known that in addition to
                        fare-paying passengers they carried a great number of fleas.

                        storey tenements of Greenside Place did not increase, because they were already so overcrowded
                        that no further increase was possible. Fever statistics and Public Health Reports reveal the
                        terrible state of working-class housing.

                        elegantly upholstered it in 1851 and at the request of the Justices of the Peace,
                        Midlothian, obtained a fire certificate signed by architect David Rhind. The fire
                        certificate may have reassured the audience but in May 1853 the Theatre was “reduced to

                        at great expense, and in a style of chaste elegance which in that respect made it one of the
                        handsomest theaters in the Kingdom”. Within a few months, however, during the run of “Little
                        Tommy Tucker” it burned down again. This time, though the fire occurred late one winter’s
                        afternoon when only one person was inside, and though he was rescued from the roof by a
                        ladder, the gable wall next to St. Mary’s Chapel fell, trapping a man, and in attempting to
                        rescue him the Dean of Guild and five others were killed.

                    <p class="green">In 1911, Walter McPhail described Leith Street as “as busier than ever, with
                        variety, life and light about it, one of the most brilliantly
                        illuminated thoroughfares in any city, and the brightest in Edinburgh”.
                    </p>
                    <p class="green">There were 22 pubs
                        between Leith Street and York Place and many ice-cream shops. McPhail continues: “In the
                        electric light
                        they flash like ice-bergs in the sunshine. Internally some of them are beautifully firred ip
                        with mahogany and crystal; while the metal-work shines like that on a man of war.” There were
                        dairies with polished zinc counters. LittleJhon’s tearoom was famous for its shortbread. The
                        shop at the top of Letih Street was Edinburgh Rock Shop, and opposite were Ruthersford’s Spanish
                        Lounge.
